# ahk-totitlecase
An AutoHotKey method for intelligently converting strings to title case. 

This is an AutoHotKey conversion of [to-title-case](https://github.com/gouch/to-title-case) by [David Gouch](https://github.com/gouch), itself an adaptation of John Gruber's [title case efforts](https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case).

## About This Conversion

This project was converted from JavaScript to AutoHotKey by MollyRealized with the assistance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The original functionality has been preserved, with adaptations made for AutoHotKey's specific syntax and capabilities.
